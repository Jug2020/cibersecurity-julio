This is a simple reflection attack.  The attack will send several transactions.
Each time a transaction is seen by the MITM, it is pushed onto a FIFO.  All
transactions going from the bank to the ATM are just forwarded on by the MITM
(no modifications).  However, all transactions going from the ATM back to the
bank are dropped and never send to the bank.  Instead, the bank's own
transactions (the same one sent to the ATM) is reflected back to the bank.
