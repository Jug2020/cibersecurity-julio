This is a simple packtet tampering attack.  The attack will run three
transactions, an account creation and two deposits.  Each time a transaction is
seen by the MITM, it is pushed onto a FIFO.  All transactions are subject to 
packet size increase, which leads to decryption errors. These should be caught 
and a protocol_error should be returned.
