This is a simple reflection attack.  The attack will send several transactions.
Each time a transaction is seen by the MITM, it is pushed onto a FIFO.  All
transactions going from the ATM to the bank are just forwarded on by the MITM
(no modifications).  However, all transactions going from the bank back to the
ATM are dropped and never send to the ATM.  Instead, the ATM's own transactions
(the same one sent to the bank) is reflected back to the ATM.
