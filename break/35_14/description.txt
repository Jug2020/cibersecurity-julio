The specs (https://coursera.builditbreakit.org/static/doc/fall2015coursera/spec/index.html) mention that "all other errors, specified throughout this document or unrecoverable errors not explicitly discussed, should prompt the program to exit with return code 255". This includes the situation when a specified parameter such "-h" does not exist, as per the following command:
./atm -h
