This is a simple replay (substitution) attack.  The attack will run three
transactions, an account creation and two deposits.  Each time a transaction is
seen by the MITM, it is pushed onto a FIFO.  For the first two transactions
everything is allowed to proceed as normal.  However, when we run the second
deposit, the MITM will instead "replay" the first deposit replacing the second
deposit's transaction.  So instead of getting two unique deposits, the bank
will get two identical deposits.
