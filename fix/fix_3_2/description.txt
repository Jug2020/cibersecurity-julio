With regard to test submission 2876, this error is due to not exiting properly when
the -h option is inserted to the ./atm. By default the -h option provides a list of 
command line options but according to the problem specification we need to overide 
the default behaviour by exiting with 255 when -h is passed as an option. Correcting 
this behaviour at line 66 of ./atm solves this issue.
