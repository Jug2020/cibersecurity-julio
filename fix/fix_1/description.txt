With regard to test submission 4535, this error is due to the incorrect exit code
when the ATM tries to connect to a wrong port or ip address. In line 181 of the ./atm 
the correct error code should be 255 but instead the error code was 63. 
Correcting this error code to 255 solves this issue. 

In addition it should also be noted that submissions 4765 and 4763 are duplicates as 
well as submissions 4535 and 3273.
