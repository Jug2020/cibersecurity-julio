With regard to test submission 1977, this error is due to the fact that the card 
specified as another user's name is not detected. When "bob" creates a card with the 
name ted.card, and then the account "ted" is created with no card name provided, the 
transaction should fail. This behaviour can be corrected by checking whether the card 
exists whenever a new account is created without the card name specified. The issue 
is corrected at line 336 of ./atm.
