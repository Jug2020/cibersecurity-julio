With regard to test submission 3603, this error is due to a mistake in the regex 
expression in line 41 of the ./atm.The regex expression does not parse leading zeros 
in a IP address correctly; any IP address which contains leading zeros in its four 
numbers will be parsed as correct. Correcting this error with a new regex expression 
which invalidates IP addresses with leading zeros solves the problem.
