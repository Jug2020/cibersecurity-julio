With regard to test submission 4163, this error is due to a card file being passed as 
a bank authentication file. This results in the program trying to process the card file
as a bank authentication file and the outcome is a TypeError. Properly handling this 
exception and exiting with 255 resolves this issue. The exceptions are handled at all 
points at which the authentication file is processed by the program. The issue is 
corrected at lines, 92, 127 and 157.
