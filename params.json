The contest evaluates participants' abilities to develop secure and efficient programs. The contest is broken up into three rounds that take place over consecutive weekends. During the Build It round, builders write software that implements the system prescribed by the contest. In the Break It round, breakers find as many flaws as possible in the Build It implementations submitted by other teams. During the Fix It round, builders attempt to fix any problems in their Build It submissions that were identified by other breaker teams.\r\n\r\n## Team Details\r\n\r\nOur team, the **DarkKnights** consisted of five members;\r\n\r\n- [Kieth Gover][keith]\r\n- [Johann Roturier][johann]\r\n- [Sudharaka Palamakumbura][sudharaka]\r\n- [Yannis Pappas][yannis]\r\n- [Sri Yogesh Dorbala][yogesh]\r\n\r\n## Programming Problem (ATM Protocol)\r\n\r\nThe detailed problem specification is given at the [ATM Protocol page][atm_prot]. \r\n\r\n## Scoring Details\r\n\r\nThe scoring details for the Capstone competition is given at the [Contest Details page][contest_details]\r\n\r\n## BreakIT BuildIT and FixIT Round Details\r\n\r\nOur program passed all correctness and performance tests in the BreakIT round.
